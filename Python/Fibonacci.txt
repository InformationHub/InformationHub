Here is source code of the Python Program to find the fibonacci series without using recursion. 
The program output is also shown below.

a=int(input("Enter the first number of the series "))
b=int(input("Enter the second number of the series "))
n=int(input("Enter the number of terms needed "))
print(a,b,end=" ")
while(n-2):
    c=a+b
    a=b
    b=c
    print(c,end=" ")
    n=n-1

Program Explanation
1. User must enter the first two numbers of the series and the number of terms to be printed.
2. The first two terms are printed outside the while loop.
3. A while loop is used to find the sum of the first two terms and proceed the series by interchanging the variables.
4. The value of n is decremented.
5. The fibonacci series is printed till n-2 is greater than 0.

Runtime Test Cases
 
Case 1:
Enter the first number of the series 0
Enter the second number of the series 1
Enter the number of terms needed 4
0 1 1 2 
 
Case 2:
Enter the first number of the series 2
Enter the second number of the series 4
Enter the number of terms needed 5
