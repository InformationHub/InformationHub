Here is the source code of the Python Program to read a number n and print an identity matrix of the desired size.
The program output is also shown below.

n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
for i in range(0,n):
    for j in range(0,n):
        if(i==j):
            print("1",sep=" ",end=" ")
        else:
            print("0",sep=" ",end=" ")
    print()

Program Explanation
1.	User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.
2.	The outer for loop enables j to range between 1 and n-1 (as n is not included) while the inner for loop also enables i to range between 1 and n-1.
3.	For each iteration, the value of 1 is printed if i is equal to j and value of 0 is printed otherwise.
4.	The sep and end parameters of the print function help in formatting and print() allows values to printed in a new line for each iteration of the outer for loop.
